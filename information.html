								<h2 style="color:paleturquoise">how it started?</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Other/keyboard.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I was born in Manisa. Due to my father's profession, I had the opportunity to live in many parts of Turkey. I have lived in the west, east and south of Turkey for years. Because of this, I got to know many different cultures.</p>
								<p>My school life was also quite rich. I think that seeing too many schools gives me different competencies. When I reached high school, my dream was to be a good engineer, but I didn't know what to do specifically.</p>
								<p>After high school, I decided to become a computer engineer. Working on abstract concepts and applying them gave me pleasure. computers and software was where I belonged. In my university life, I was in search of finding out in which field I would develop software. After many trials such as game development, web development, desktop applications, I found the field I wanted to work in. I was going to be a mobile developer.</p>

								<br/><br/>

								<h2 style="color:chartreuse ;">Why Android Development?</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Other/android.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>If I'm sincere, this is the job I wanted to do, even if I was a little condescending at first. passion was what mattered to me and android programming had become a job I wanted. but the process developed somewhat painfully. web, desktop applications with java, python language I could not enjoy enough. I had to keep looking for the job field I wanted.</p>
								<p>Before working on native Android apps, the closest area I was in was game development. but the fact that game development consisted of too many intermediate processes was slowing my progress. If you wanted to advance in game making, you were responsible for many things such as design, modeling, level design, sound and music, software, necessary hardware. This job was a team job and my wishes were to work on an area where I could improve myself. Being able to work on your own in a field where you "always" need more people is a difficult luxury. I didn't like that it slowed me down. Then I discovered android development. it was perfect for me.</p>
								<p>The first OOP language I learned during my school years was Java. I think java is a very beautiful language. When I first learned about it, I liked the paradigms it had. Therefore, being able to write a mobile application with Java was a good reason for me to try this job. So I tried java and mobile development. The result was positive. This was the starting step of my career.</p>

								<br/><br/>

								<h2 style="color:blueviolet">Why Kotlin?</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Other/kotlin_outside.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Programming in Java was a very good experience in the beginning. Android studio was a great ide for this job (though most people didn't like it). But after the rise of kotlin and the advice of the developers (even google) I decided to give a try to kotlin. At this stage, I realized that Kotlin is making the difference with Java day by day. Many of the corporate companies write their native applications in java, but kotlin was a great investment for the future.</p>
								<p>Kotlin is as fun to write as java, but it is a more functional language. New technology and libraries are being developed for kotlin, not java. google provides great support and even though it is born from the paradigms of java it has its own peculiarities. Kotlin is a fast, powerful, readable and robust language. Jetpack libraries, KMM (for cross-platform), idiosyncratic programming constructs (data classes, sealed classes...) have put this language above java lately.</p>
								<p>So Kotlin is a special language and it is the right choice for me. I continue my work with Kotlin and am ready to do more for the future. The future is exciting...</p>
